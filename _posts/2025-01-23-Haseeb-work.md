1. Introduction
 With an increase in the number of players in the telecom industry, advancements in technology, and an increased cost of living, the telecom sector has become more and more competitive. As of 2023, there are an estimated 936 wireless telecommunications businesses in the U.S. In Europe, there are more than 150 telecom operators. (Yelshanska, M. and Nechet, K., 2023).
It has become a challenge for these companies to retain their customer base and decrease the churn rate. To truly understand the behaviour of the customer and the factors that are contributing to the decision-making of the customer advanced data analysis techniques can be used. The analysis of the techniques can help the companies to understand the patterns in customer behaviour and examine the dissatisfaction journey of a customer. (van Houtum, B., 2022).
Therefore, this report examines the data of customers of a telecom company to examine the churn rate and the behaviour of churned customers with respect to different customer attributes and the type of service they opted for. Lastly, the report will try to understand if there are any patterns among the churned customers by using different supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.
